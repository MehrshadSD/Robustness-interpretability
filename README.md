# Robustness-Interpretability
Hey there! Welcome to this repository, where we'll walk you through creating a robust and interpretable model using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.

If your main goal is to train a model using adversarial training, you can dive right into our tutorial by checking out the "Pancreas data_adv training.ipynb" file.

For those eager to explore the interpretability of the adversarially trained model, we have you covered in the "Adv training and interpretability.ipynb" section.

If you encounter any issues while running the platform or need assistance with anything, don't hesitate to reach out. I am also open to collaboration in this exciting field, so feel free to get in touch anytime. ðŸ˜Š
